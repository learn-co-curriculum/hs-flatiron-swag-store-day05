## Flatiron Swag Shop!

People love our Flatiron swag so much they are [singing about it](https://docs.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/file/d/0B_qWLnYbXOdPS2tMbHVpOG1GUVE/edit). We desperately need your help building an app to sell our sweet Flatiron merch. Follow the steps below to get started.

Step 1 - Set up your app and MVC directories.

Step 2 - Set up your config directory with your environment file (Hint: It's totally okay to copy the config file from your Fwitter project, but don't forget to customize it where necessary.)

Step 3 - Set up your public directory with directories for css, img and js.

Step 4 - Set up your config.ru, Gemfile and Rakefile (totally okay to copy from Fwitter again!)

Step 5 - Now for the MVC. In the words of Yeezy, it's all about the models. We'll start off with one model/table for Items with the following attributes/columns:

```ruby
:name
:image_url 
:price
:count
```

Set up your Item class (don't forget to inherit from from ActiveRecord::Base) and create a migration for the items table `rake db:create_migration NAME="create_items"`. 

Don't forget to run the migration too! Type `rake -T` into your terminal if you need a reminder on what the command to migrate is.

Step 6 - Let's add some items to our database! Boot up `tux` in your terminal and create some new items. Here are some images links that you can use:

+ [hoodie](https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/flatiron-swag-store-lab/flatiron_hoodie.jpg)
+ [men's tee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/flatiron-swag-store-lab/flatiron_tee_m.jpg)
+ [women's tee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/flatiron-swag-store-lab/flatiron_tee_w.jpg)
+ [tote](https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/flatiron-swag-store-lab/flatiron_tote.jpg)

You can set your own price and decide the count that you have in stock.

Step 7 - We've got the M covered, now let's move onto the V. In your views directory create an `items.erb` file that will display all of the merch for our store - including each item's name, photo and price.

Step 8 - Set up your `get '/items'` route to pull all of your items from the database and display them in your new `items.erb` template.

Take a look at that swag!

## Bonus Challenges
+ Add an inventory page that displays the count for each item.
+ Set up a User model (with attributes for name and email) and a sign up page.
+ Set up a form that lists all the items and allows users to chose how many of each item they would like to order. Hint: There is a `type="number"` attribute for form inputs. Google it! 
  * When the form is submitted, the items' inventory (count) should decrease and a new entry should be created in a Purchases table. More on that below!
+ Set up a Purchase model that will track user's purchases. 
  * This table will have two columns - user_id and item_id. Tables like this are called join tables because they connect (or join) objects from other models/tables.
  * You'll also need to set up new ActiveRecord relationships for each model. The Purchase model `belongs_to` users and items. The User and Item models both `has_many` purchases. This may seem a little strange but just roll with it.
  * If you set up your `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationships properly you'll be able to get a list of everything a user has purchased from the store with something like `@user.purchases`.
+ Welcome to the wonderful world of eCommerce!
